# YOLO Table

**Web link:** 

## Purpose:
I've been watching development, reading about, and actively using various YOLO (You Only Look Once) networks for multiple years. There's been so much development since 2015, and I thought a simple website listing the different YOLO networks, their relative performance, and source could help someone who might be a little lost in the sea of information.

## Contributing:
**Please note that this repository is still under construction!** Feel free to create an issue regarding any *incorrect* information.

For issues related to *missing* YOLO networks, I will be creating issue templates for new network entries and an automated PR system for adding these networks once approved. While that is still being developed, you can leave issues with the general format:

```
